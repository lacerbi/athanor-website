Think of it as a workbench with a set of tools and knobs to make AI workflow actually practical. Athanor helps you:\\r\\n\\r\\n- **Intelligently select** relevant files for your AI prompts\\r\\n- **Generate comprehensive prompts** with proper context\\r\\n- **Safely apply AI-generated changes** with full visibility and control\\r\\n- **Work with any AI assistant** - no API keys required for core functionality\\r\\n\\r\\nAthanor is an **open-source** project and you can find it [on GitHub](https://github.com/lacerbi/athanor).\\r\\n\\r\\n## Why Athanor?\\r\\n\\r\\nAthanor was born out of my frustration with using standard chat interfaces for AI-assisted development for code and technical writing:\\r\\n\\r\\n- Gathering files manually was a pain, even using tools such as [`repomix`](https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix)\\r\\n- Most of my workflow consisted of fairly standardized operations (planning features, requesting changes, summarizing files) that I found myself retyping constantly.\\r\\n- Integrating the AI output back into a project\u2013whether a codebase, a website, or technical writing\u2013is painful:\\r\\n  - When the AI outputs just a snippet, you need to manually copy-paste it at exactly the right place\\r\\n  - When the AI outputs the entire file, it sometimes messes up or _forgets_ something else along the way\u2013and some files are just too large, so waiting for the full output is unwieldy\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso, having already multiple AI subscriptions, I wasn\'t too keen on switching to a pure API workflow or token-hungry AI coding agents (not yet at least).\\r\\n\\r\\n**That\'s how Athanor began.** And now, after months of using it to build itself, I\'m ready to share it with you.\\r\\n\\r\\n## What\'s on This Website\\r\\n\\r\\nI have put together documentation that covers what I thought would be useful for a newcomer. Yes, of course I have used Athanor and various AI assistants to help me with this (but this is me writing, working from an excessively salesman-y draft of this post).\\r\\n\\r\\nMost importantly, [**the Tutorial**](/docs/tutorial/introduction) takes you from installation to your first real workflow. It goes from basic prompts to customizing your Athanor experience to your specific needs.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Where We\'re At\\r\\n\\r\\nAthanor is in **alpha**. What does that mean practically?\\r\\n\\r\\n- It works. I have been using it daily for months (including to build Athanor itself from `v0.1.0`)\\r\\n- There are rough edges. Sometimes you\'ll hit a weird bug\\r\\n- Features are still evolving based on what actually helps vs. what seemed like a good idea\\r\\n- Many features are still in the wishlist\\r\\n\\r\\nYour feedback at this stage is gold. If something is annoying or broken, please let me know.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Try It Out\\r\\n\\r\\nRight now, Athanor runs in developer mode:\\r\\n\\r\\n```bash\\r\\ngit clone https://github.com/lacerbi/athanor.git\\r\\ncd athanor && npm install\\r\\nnpm run dev\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n## What\'s Coming\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the next few weeks, I will be focusing on basic improvements:\\r\\n\\r\\n- Making it more stable\\r\\n- Increasing test coverage (yes, I know)\\r\\n- Performance improvements for larger projects (this will require making the _Smart Preview_ actually smart)\\r\\n- More prompt templates based on actual use cases\\r\\n- Eventually, packaged releases so you do not need to run from source\\r\\n\\r\\nThe roadmap will also depend on what you tell me.\\r\\n\\r\\n## One More Thing\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the moment, one thing Athanor is pretty good at is building Athanor.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Athanor codebase, after an initial old-school \\"copy-paste\\" period, has been almost entirely written with Athanor. The _almost_ is there just for academic precision\u2013more than 99% of the code was written and integrated using Athanor. I have made a few manual changes here and here, when it was faster for me to fix a typo by hand than going through a prompt.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith this, I have experienced first-hand how development has become smoother and smoother. Having smarter models helped too, or course.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnyhow, I think you might find Athanor useful too. Give it a try, and let me know how it goes.\\r\\nYou can contact me on a variety of social media or directly on Athanor\'s [GitHub issues](https://github.com/lacerbi/athanor/issues) or [discussions](https://github.com/lacerbi/athanor/discussions).\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n_Luigi Acerbi, building Athanor one prompt at a time_"}]}}')}}]);
